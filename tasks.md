7. Error Handling & Responses:

   All endpoints should provide proper error handling.
   Responses should include HTTP status codes indicating success (e.g., 200, 201), failure (e.g., 400, 404), or server errors (e.g., 500).
   Include helpful error messages in the response body for failed requests.

Security & Authentication:

    Use HTTPS to secure all API endpoints.
    Utilize JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or similar mechanisms for authentication.
    Make sure to sanitize and validate all inputs to prevent SQL injections, NoSQL injections, and other malicious attacks.

This API design provides a solid foundation for the proposed application. Depending on requirements, some endpoints might need pagination, filtering, or sorting features. Always keep scalability, performance, and security in mind when implementing these APIs.
